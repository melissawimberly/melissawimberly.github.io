    <p class="first">Hello again All! This week we are going to talk about a few of the differences between Ruby and JavaScript.</p>

<p class="bodyp">After learning how objects interact with each other in Ruby, JavaScript isn't too scary. The main difference that I have noticed between the two is the syntax. </p>

<p class="bodyp">Lets look at a few syntactical differences between the languages!</p>

<p class="bodyp">JavaScript objects look a lot like Ruby Hashes. They also perform similarly. JavaScript objects are composite data structures comprised of properties. These properties (like keys) hold values that describe the object. This makes declaring properties  for a variable in JavaScript very similar to adding key/value pairs to a hash in Ruby. Check it out:</p>

<div class="codexmp">
<p>hash = { name: "Melissa" } #ruby hash </p>

<p>puts hash[:name] #prints "Melissa" </p>

<p>var obj = { name: "Melissa" } // javascript object</p> 

<p>console.log(obj["name"]) //prints "Melissa" </p>

</div>


<p class="bodyp">Functions in JavaScript are the same as methods in Ruby. They both define a block of code that can be assigned to any number of objects in the future, and will do the same operation whenever its called. </p>

<div class="codexmp">
<p>def name</p>
<p>  puts "Melissa"</p>
<p>end</p>
<p># this Ruby declaration defines a method, name, that prints the string "Melissa"</p>
</div>

<div class="codexmp">
<p>function name() {</p>
<p>  console.log("Melissa");</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>//this JavaScript declaration creates a function, name, that logs the string "Melissa" to the console</p>
</div>

<p class="bodyp">Both declarations are doing the same thing here, which is printing the string Melissa to the terminal. The two languages simply vary in syntax.</p>


<p class="bodyp">It's important to note that another difference between Ruby and JavaScript is in the style of Object Oriented Programming. Ruby is a class based language, which means the structure and behavior of an object is defined by a class. By this model, objects in Ruby must be explicitly created based on a class and an object, making all Ruby objects an instance of a class. JavaScript, on the other hand, is not class based. The properties that are created do not have restricted access.</p>

<p class="bodyp">However this is not something that is immediately apparent. It is more xwhats happening under the hood.</p>



<p class="bodyp">That should give you a good base as to how Ruby and JavaScript differ.  Happy coding  </p>
