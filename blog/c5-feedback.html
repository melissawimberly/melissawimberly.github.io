    <p class="bodyp">Dev Bootcamp is a dedicated to making sure that students not only understand all of the concepts presented, but are also able to explain them to someone else. By encouraging us to pair program on a few exercises a week, we each get the opportunity to solidify our knowledge by explaining it to another, as well as use it to solve other abstract problems. </p>

<p class="bodyp">(ok maybe this is a little exaggerated, but Pair Programming really can be very fun!)</p>


<p class="bodyp">As a Kinesthetic - Aural learner, I learn best by hearing how one should solve a problem, and then using my newly acquired knowledge to work through practice problems. Pair programming is essentially exactly that! It gives both members of the pair the chance to teach, learn, explore and solidify concepts. </p>

<p class="bodyp">I find working with a partner to be the most efficient use of my time. Not only do I have someone else relying on me to stay on task, but I also have someone who will inevitably  know something different from me. This is extremely helpful because it often results in an alternate idea for how to solve the problem. Even if my parter's idea differs from my own idea only ever so slightly, I am still going to learn something new, and isn’t that what it’s all about? (well that and the hokey pokey)

<p class="bodyp">Thus far, in my programming career, I have greatly enjoyed pair programming. It has given me a window into other engineers' minds, and a means to incorporate others' thoughts and ideas into my own programs. Although there are always details of challenges that one partner overlooks, or understands in a different way than their partner, both members of the team need to be able to understand and explain each line of code submitted. Pair programming forces students to write code that follows this criteria.</p>

 <p class="bodyp">The most rewarding aspect of pair programming is when you are able to help another person understand where they have gone wrong in their code. This requires a solid understanding of the topic at hand. Often times, while attempting to explain something to a pair about how I think a certain line of code can be improved, I realize something new about the concept that I had not previously realized. This allows me to teach, learn, and solidify!</p>

<p class="bodyp">Now while I do in fact think that Pair Programming is the bees knees, it can also have some difficult aspects. What if you and your partner cannot agree on a solution? What if your partner doesn’t listen to any of your ideas? 
Well my friend, welcome to the real world! In all of our future endeavors, we will be forced to work with people who are different from us, who don’t listen to us, who don’t work well with us. And while it might be frustrating working with them, they absolutely/inevitably know something different from us. So we have to force ourselves to listen, learn, give feedback and move on!</p>

<p class="bodyp">It is extremely important that, as developers, we are able to both give and receive feedback. While it can sometimes be challenging receiving particularly harsh feedback, is necessary for us to know our strengths and weaknesses, and to try to improve upon the latter. I have received feedback that made me happy, proud, surprised, disappointed, confused and a medley of other emotions. But ultimately I think it was necessary for me to receive all of the feedback, because I am able to find trends (as well as outliers) in the feedback I receive. This helps me better structure my approach to challenges and pair programming. When writing feedback it is important to be kind, specific and actionable. Try to write feedback that you think would help you to improve. I often find it hard to give actionable feedback. I don’t want to hurt my partners’ feelings, but I have learned that it is better for everyone to be honest about what could have been done better. Otherwise the person is not aware of the things that they need to work on, and will continue to practice bad habits. By kindly pointing out actionable 
For example, one instance of feedback that I received told me that I should try to use shortcuts more often so as to move through challenges faster. This was a very specific aspect of my coding process that I am far more conscious about now, and have been trying to improve upon. </p>

<p class="bodyp">Pair programming and feedback are like milk and cookies, you can’t have one without the other! </p>
