Chefs in the Kitchen

2nd November, 2014


Watching Shereef's Fireside Chat was far more beneficial than I expected. I assumed it would be a pitch for how amazing DevBootcamp is, which, duh I already know! However I was happily surprised to hear his advice for how to approach the DBC experience.


After watching the video I realized that DevBootcamp is even more centered around the notion of an active community than I initially thought. I greatly appreciated the Kitchen vs. Table analogy because it pointed out that you are not the only chef in the kitchen. You need to be active in your learning, but you also have a whole kitchen full of other active chefs who can share recipes with you, walk you through techniques, and respectfully point out when you've made a mistake. This makes me feel a bit more confident.


After watching this video I also realized that I need to change my mindset if I want to succeed. I have absolutely been thinking about DevBootcamp as something that I see on a menu, purchase, and then easily consume (although after this first week of challenges, I was starting to figure out that that wasn't the case). I knew that I would need to work hard, but it is equally important for me to take charge of this time and learn everything I can, using all the resources I have available to me. Basically after the video, I got up from the table and marched right into that kitchen!


I was also glad that Shereef pointed out the fears that students have coming into DevBootcamp. After attending my Intro Session, I quickly became fearful that I would be the only novice of my cohort. I was suddenly extremely aware that I have no coding background AT ALL. However, Shereef made me feel like I might not be the only one feeling that way, and even if I am, everyone in my cohort has a lot to learn about programming. There will be topics that no student in the room has seen before, so we will all be novices. This also made me a bit more confident.


Ultimately I am still pretty darn nervous about this experience. I am excited to be a part of DBC, but I am scared as hell for what's to come. At least now I have an approach that I am sure will work!
