		<h4>Chefs in the Kitchen</h4>

		<h4>2nd November, 2014</h4>


		<p>Watching Shereef's Fireside Chat was far more beneficial than I expected. I assumed it would be a pitch for how amazing DevBootcamp is, which, duh I already know! However I was happily surprised to hear his advice for how to approach the DBC experience.</p>


		<p>After watching the video I realized that DevBootcamp is even more centered around the notion of an active community than I initially thought. I greatly appreciated the Kitchen vs. Table analogy because cooking, and food in general, has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember! This analogy pointed out that you are not the only chef in the kitchen. You need to be active in your learning, but you also have a whole kitchen full of other active chefs who can share recipes with you, walk you through techniques, and respectfully point out when you've made a mistake. This makes me feel a bit more confident.</p>


		<p>After watching this video I also realized that I need to change my mindset if I want to succeed. I have absolutely been thinking about DevBootcamp as something that I see on a menu, purchase, and then easily consume (although after this first week of challenges, I was starting to figure out that that wasn't the case). I knew that I would need to work hard, but it is equally important for me to take charge of this time and learn everything I can, using all the resources I have available to me. Basically after the video, I got up from the table and marched right into that kitchen!</p>


		<p>I was also glad that Shereef pointed out the fears that students have coming into DevBootcamp. After attending my Intro Session, I quickly became fearful that I would be the only novice of my cohort. I was suddenly extremely aware that I have no coding background AT ALL. However, Shereef made me feel like I might not be the only one feeling that way, and even if I am, everyone in my cohort has a lot to learn about programming. There will be topics that no student in the room has seen before, so we will all be novices. This also made me a bit more confident.</p>


		<p>Ultimately I am still pretty darn nervous about this experience. I am excited to be a part of DBC, but I am scared as hell for what's to come. At least now I have an approach that I am sure will work!</p>
