    <p class="bodyp">The tech industry is arguably the fastest growing and most rapidly changing industry to date. There are major changes and updates being made every minute, and the field is expected to continue on its exponential growth path. While so many aspects of the tech field are as progressive as possible, there are a few aspects that are still struggling, and a bit behind the time. One of the most glaring problems is the lack of diversity in the tech world. </p>

<p class="bodyp">Scarily enough, in today's top companies there are a dismal amount of minority employees. According to reports, companies such as Apple, Google, Twitter, Linkedin, and Yahoo have a shockingly small 4% of employees who are Hispanic, and only 3% of whom are African American. These numbers would actually be even lower if it weren't for Apple's engineering team. </p>
<p class="bodyp">And that's not all, these companies have an average  70% to 30% Men to Women ratio.</p>
<p class="bodyp">Why are these numbers so low for minorities? Are these companies purposefully not hiring minorities? Do minorities not want to work for tech companies? What is the deal?</p>

<p class="bodyp">There are many possible reasons for these stats, all equally plausible, but the one that I have found most true is that it's not the big companies, but rather the path to the big companies that could use updating. </p>

<p class="bodyp">Companies like Google, Twitter, and Apple have recruiters and representatives present at every Stanford Career Fair. There are multiple Fortune 500 executives who are on the Board of Alums at schools like Harvard and Yale. It is not easy for students of top institutions to get jobs at the nation's top companies, but the path is clear and marked for them. The path to these top tiered schools is also marked for students from the best private schools, as well as public schools in wealthy neighborhoods. Again, there is absolutely no automatic acceptance for students from these elite high schools, but this part of the path is also clearly marked for them. </p>

<p class="bodyp">But how about students whose parents are unable to afford private schools? What about the students who live in area codes that force them to attend sub par public schools. Or what about the female students who have been taught by media and society that careers in these companies are for men, and that's just the way it is? These student's paths to careers at these top companies are undoubtedly quite a bit muddier. With knowledge of  what these companies expect much less accessible, often these students are not able to prepare for what is to be expected of them in the future. This leaves them with less than amazing resumes, very few extracurriculars, and a lack of confidence that virtually guts their chance to compete for a career at any top company. This institutionalized inequality ensures a lack of diversity at these Fortune 500 companies. </p>

<p class="bodyp">But what can be done about this lack of equality? Should those with a path paved by opportunity and privilege be judged harder than those without? While this may seem like a reasonable solution, it is really just another form of inequality. Instead of trying to punish one group, how about we try to lift up the the other group. By requiring that each of these companies has representatives who frequent under-privileged high schools as well as privileged ones, students of all varying SSE backgrounds will be given some insight as to what is to come, and what will be expected of them. By forcing these companies to give internships to students from state schools, and community colleges as well as those from Ivy League universities, students from all academic paths will be given a chance at success. This will also provide hope for other students who were not able to attend Ivy league schools, that there is still an opportunity for them even though they are not attending a top tiered school.</p>


<p class="bodyp">Today's top tech companies are making incredible strides in the progression of technology, but it is time that they made similar strides in the diversification of the tech field. By making their resources more accessible to all types of people of varying ethnic, socioeconomic, and gender backgrounds, the likelihood of a more diverse workspace will be far more attainable. A more diverse workspace will lead to more diverse products and thus a more widespread inspiration that a tech career is possible. </p>
