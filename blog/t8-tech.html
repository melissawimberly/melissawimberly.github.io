<!--     <p id="subtitle">Technical Blog 8: Ruby vs Ruby on Rails</p> -->

<p class="bodyp">Hey everyone, today we will be learning about the difference between Ruby and Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p class="bodyp">As we all know by now, Ruby is a scripting language. That means it supports scripts (programs that can automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator). Rails is a software library that extends the Ruby programming language. More over it’s a Web app framework that is built using Ruby.</p>

<p class="bodyp">So lets break this down a bit. Here is a synopsis of the plethora of explanations I found to better explain the difference between the two. </p>

<p class="bodyp">Ruby and Rails are a close knight pair. Since Rails is a web app framework, anything that you write in a Rails application is simply Ruby code. When you run a rails application, you are just interpreting the Ruby code using the Ruby interpreter. Ruby on Rails makes it easy to use the language Ruby to write code that makes a dynamic database driven website work. The two not only work together, but Ruby on Rails DEPENDS on Ruby!</p>
<p class="bodyp">As one person put it: "Ruby is to Rails is to a Rails application as English is to the novel (as a literary 'framework') is to The Great Gatsby."</p>

<p class="bodyp">Alrighty now that we understand the difference, lets learn about this Ruby on Rails. What does it do?</p>

<p class="bodyp">Rails is software code that is added to the Ruby programming language. Technically, it is a package library (specifically, a RubyGem), that is installed using the operating system command-line interface.</p>
<p class="bodyp">Rails combines the Ruby programming language with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web application that runs on a web server. It is interesting to note that because it runs on a web server, Rails is considered a server-side, or “back end,” web application development platform (the web browser is the “front end”).</p>

<p class="bodyp">Get it? Good! Just remember you can’t have Rails without Ruby!</p>
<p class="bodyp">I will leave you with what has to be the best description of the difference between the two:
Ruby is a stripper; Rails is the pole; When they get together, developers get really happy!</p>
