    <p class="bodyp">Hey Guys! This week we are going to be discussing conflicts. DUN DUN DUN….</p>

<p class="bodyp">I know it can be awkward or sappy or just overall unpleasant to discuss conflicts, but don’t worry this is not like that. This blog entry is more about breaking down conflicts and emotions felt at the time of a conflict, and  analyzing the experience.</p>

<p class="bodyp">A few weeks back I had a spoke in my bike tire pop off, and by my bike I mean my brothers’ bike that I was “borrowing”. I immediately called the guy that fixed my brother’s bike last time to get a quote for the fix. He quoted me $200, which i thought was rather steep, so I negotiated him down to $100. </p>
<p class="bodyp">Upon bringing the bike to his garage I brought some chocolates (for good measure), and told him I could pick up the bike the next Saturday, as I have work on the weekdays. </p>

<p class="bodyp">That Wednesday he called me and told me the bike was ready that day, and each day that I don’t pick it up, I would be charged $50! This was obviously in an effort to make up the $100 that I had talked him down. Livid, I called him immediately and demanded an explanation. He tried to explain to me that he didn’t have space in his garage to store my bicycle for extra days. However I had already explained that Saturday was the only day I was able to pick up the bicycle, so I knew that he was just trying to scam me. I immediately went on the offensive and started yelling on the phone and demanding fair treatment, to which he responded negatively. </p>

<p class="bodyp">Ultimately I was able to get my friend to go pick up the bike that same day so that I wasn’t charged any extra fees, but I was irate at the fact that he tried to scam me like that! I was upset that he had agreed to charge me one price, and then got greedy and tried to make more money off of me. I was shocked at his lack of loyalty as my brother has taken his bike there many times before. I was disappointed that I had gone the extra mile and brought him chocolates, and taken a few of his business cards to distribute, and he STILL tried to scam me!</p>

<p class="bodyp">In hindsight I wish I would've taken a beat before blowing up on the phone. It was really unnecessary for me to react in that manner. Deep (deep deep deep) down I know that if someone yelled at me on the phone the way that I did, I would respond negatively as well. It wouldn't make me want to cooperate or dismiss the fees, as a matter of fact it would make me more stubborn. While it was wrong for him to try to cheat me, everyone is hustling to make a buck these days, so why should he be any different? </p>
<p class="bodyp">While I’m glad that the anger instilled a sense of urgency in me that made me think about all of my resources, I wish I wouldn’t have made my anger apparent on the phone. </p>


<p class="bodyp">The most important thing that I took away from this experience was to breath! In trying situations, like this one, it is always best to take a beat, and not let your anger get the best of you. Think about the resources that you can use to help you remedy the situation, and calmly walk away from the situation. This is the formula that I wish I would have used in during my conflict, and it is definitely the one I will use next time!</p>
