      <p class="introp">Hey Guys!</p>

      <p class="bodyp">Today, I am going to be (very) briefly discussing how it felt to create my first website.</p>

      <p class="bodyp">Creating my first website was quite an experience. To say the least, t was some kind of a roller coaster! </p>
       <p class="bodyp">At times it was instantly gratifying, while at other times it was instantly frustrating! There were times when I wanted to share my webpage with everyone I knew, and there were times I wanted to throw my computer out the window! </p>
      <p class="bodyp">Ultimately I learned more from jumping in and creating it, than reading about how to use HTML and CSS. Learning by doing seems to be the key with programming. However, I need to keep in mind that another huge part of program learning is practice. So I will need to make sure to keep practicing!  </p>
