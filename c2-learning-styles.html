    <p class="first">As we all have discovered during these first 3 weeks, this Phase 0 is NO JOKE! There is so much work to do, that you have to make sure you are spending your time as efficiently as possible. This means you have to know how you learn best, and make sure to approach each new section with the tools that work best for you.</p>

<p class="first">Thus far, my biggest struggle has been time management. Holding down a full time job while trying to keep up with all of the work in Phase 0 is no small feat. It’s extremely difficult to come home from a long 9+ hour day at work, and then start a challenge.  So many times I have been too tired to even attempt a challenge, but I try to push through and do it anyway.</p> 

<p class="first">I have found that this is where pair programming REALLY helps me. It helps me stay focused (and distracted from my tiredness) to work with a pair. It’s nice to know, before I start a challenge, that I’m not the only one who will be trying to figure out the problem. In addition to focus, I always feel like I come out of a pair programming session feeling accomplished. Whether it’s because my partner was far more advanced than I (which is usually the case), and therefore I learned a whole lot working with them. Or because I knew a few things that my partner didn’t, and thus was able to solidify my knowledge by explaining it to them. I think without pair programming, I would be struggling a lot more with Phase 0.</p>

<p class="first">This is also directly correlated with my learning style. One of the environments that Concrete Learners, such as myself, thrive in is one in which we can rely on there to complete a task. This makes pair programming the perfect aide to my learning during Phase0. My appreciation for group work is also a reflection of my VARK Learning Style. As an Aural-Kinesthetic learner I do best in situations where I am able to see and working through problems. Sharing my screen with a partner, and learning by doing, or watching them do, really helps me learn.</p>

<p class="first">In an effort to expand the way I think, I have tried to work harder on learning from reading the Ruby documentation. I usually don’t learn well from just reading how something works, but by forcing myself to understand the documentation, I am at least getting used to a new way of approaching learning. This is an effort that is going to take more than 3 weeks to get used to, but at least I am starting the process.</p>
