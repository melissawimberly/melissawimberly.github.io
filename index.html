<!-- 				<h1>Who is Melissa Wimberly?</h1> -->
        		<h1>Hello There! My name is Melissa Wimberly and I am a learning how to program! </h1>
        		<p>After studying Economics at UC Davis, I became a project manager for tech startup. I spent my days working with and managing engineers, but I had no idea what they were talking about. After a week of confusion, I decided to spend a Saturday learning some "programming buzzwords". After realizing how interesting and fun programming can be, I decided to spend every Saturday (and Sunday, and after work, and before work) trying to teach myself as much as I can. Now I am in Dev Bootcamp, and my learning is accelerating. I can't wait to see how much I have learned by the end of the program! </p>
        		<h1>Check out my blog to keep up with all the cool stuff I learn along the way!</h1>
